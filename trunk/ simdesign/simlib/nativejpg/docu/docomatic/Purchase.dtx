<title Purchase NativeJpg>
NativeJpg is now "open-source". This means that you are allowed to 
download the NativeJpg sources from simDesign BV, as long as you 
abide by the license conditions.

Whenever you purchase NativeJpg, you will have a few <b>advantages</b>, namely:

* You are entitled to ask for detailed support by email or the "source forum". Support is
  only available for the paying customers.

* Two years of free updates in the "source forum": the bugfix- and 
  beta-releases are only available for the paying customers, and they are
  more frequent than the open-source releases.

* By purchasing this software, you make it possible, for developers like me, to 
  continue to write good software.

Thank you in advance, and happy coding!
