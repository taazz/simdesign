SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

1.  License.  If you have purchased a license to the Software, the company ABC-View ("ABC-View") grants you a non-exclusive right and license to use the Software and the related documentation (the "Documentation") as set forth in this Agreement.  You may use the Software on a single computer. You may also use the Software on a second (portable or home) computer so long as only one copy is used at a time.

You may use the Documentation to assist in your use of the Software.  You may review the Documentation, but you may not make further copies of the Documentation.  You own the media on which the Software is recorded, but not the Software itself or any copy of it. This license is not a sale of the original or any copy of the Software.

    If you have obtained an evaluation copy of the Software, and have not purchased a license to the Software, ABC-View grants you a time-limited non-exclusive license to use the Software free of charge for the purpose of evaluating whether you wish to purchase an ongoing license for the Software.  

    WARNING:  Evaluation copies of the Software will become non-functional after the trial period expires. ABC-View disclaims all liability and responsibility for any loss of data or other information which may occur as a result thereof.

    You may distribute the evaluation version archive and make as many copies as you like provided that it is the official evaluation version archive. You are required to verify this.

    You are specifically prohibited from charging, or requesting donations, for any such copies, however made and from distributing the software and/or documentation with other products (commercial or otherwise) without prior written permission.

    ABC-View does not warrant that the functions contained in the Software will meet your requirements or operate in the combination that you may select for use, that the operation of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free, or that defects in the Software will be corrected.  No oral or written statement by ABC-View or by a representative of ABC-View shall create a warranty or increase the scope of this warranty.

ABC-View DOES NOT WARRANT THE SOFTWARE AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OR THE LIKE WITH RESPECT TO ANY COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADE SECRET, TRADEMARK OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHT OF ANY THIRD PARTY AND DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY VIRUS, SOFTWARE ROUTINE OR OTHER SOFTWARE DESIGNATED TO PERMIT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, TO DISABLE, ERASE OR OTHERWISE HARM SOFTWARE, HARDWARE OR DATA, OR TO PERFORM ANY OTHER SUCH ACTIONS.
