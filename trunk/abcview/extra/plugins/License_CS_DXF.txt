Software Licence
Please read the following lines carefully before using this software. If you disagree with any of the following, you are not allowed to use this Software. You MUST then delete it immediately.

Shareware-version
=============================
You have the right to test this Software for a period of one month. You are allowed to copy this Shareware-version (and ONLY the Shareware version) and give it to any other person, as long as it is not modified in any way. Under modifications is understood the changing, adding or removing of any files of this package without the author's written permission. You are NOT allowed to pack this Software together with a commercial Software or a book.. You are encouraged to put this Software on as many BBS systems as possible. The distribution on CD-ROM is also permitted, as long as the original files are not changed in any way. Please contact me if you want to distribute the Software with a different installation Software, changed files etc.

Use of this software after the trial period of one month is in violation of international Copyright law! It is also unfair to the author, who has spent hundreds of hours developing this Software.

Registration
=============================
This Software is neither freeware nor public domain. Use after the 30 day trial period requires registration. The registration fee is only 12 Euro for a personal licence. 

Registered version (personal licence)
=============================
The registered version may be installed on as many computers as desired, as long as it is used by only one person at any one time (I.e. one installation at home and one at the office used by the same person). Therefore you need only one licence for a port connection between two computers. The usage by multiple people at the same time (on multiple computers) requires additional licences.

Additional licences (multi-user licences)
=============================
Additional licences allow an institution, company or school to install the Software on multiple computers or on a server. It must be guaranteed that the Software does not run on more machines at the same time than there are licences purchased. All licences are issued to the same (company) name, which appears in the Software's title bar. For larger amounts than 10 please contact the author. Each additional licence also allows a single user to use the Software at home.

Liability
=============================
We try to keep our software as bug-free as possible. But it's a general rule (Murphy's), that no software ever is error free, and the number of errors increases with the complexity of the Software. That's why we cannot guarantee that this software will run in every environment, on any Windows compatible machine, together with any other application, without producing errors. Any liability for damage of any sort is hereby denied. In any case, the liability is limited to the registration fee.

Please test this Software with non-critical data. We cannot guarantee the safety of your data. Especially new operating systems like Windows NT or OS/2 can cause trouble. Should you detect errors before registration, you accept them if you register. Any description of bugs will be accepted, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to correct them.
