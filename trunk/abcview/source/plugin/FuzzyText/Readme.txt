filter.

Specific settings
=================

1) Click View > Options, go to the plugins tab and select the plugin,
then Edit Plugin

2) In the dialog, click on Setup

3) Change settings here:

( ) Auto-index in background
(*) Index files when filtering

Auto-index will cause ABCVM to automatically index all files it comes
across. "Index file when filtering" only starts this when the filter is
started (recommended)

Max filesize difference

By specifying a maximum difference in file size, you can speed up the
search. Only files that have not more than X bytes length difference
will be compared.

File Type filter

Here you can specify which kind of files are going to be processed.
Use the second option to specify a number of extensions. All extensions
must start with a dot and end with a semi-colon!

Limits per tolerance level

Here you can specify how many characters may be different for a certain
tolerance level. The tolerance level is specified when starting the
filter. Thus you can customize the tolerance levels here.

Allowing a higher number of characters to be different will cause more
files to show up as a match.
