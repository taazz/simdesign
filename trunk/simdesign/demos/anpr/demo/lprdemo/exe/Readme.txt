PURPOSE
This demo shows how the OCR component can recognise license plate
information

INSTRUCTIONS

1) Start the OcrDemo.exe demonstrator

2) Load the LPRDemo.xml setup file through File > Load OCR Setup
and selecting it, may take a few seconds

3) Verify that you have trainers, by clicking the Trainers tab

4) Load any of the bitmap images of cars with licenseplates,
e.g. IM_8.JPG. It will show up in the image window at 2:1 scale
(upscaled 2x) so it is easier to analyse the thresholding info
later on. Internally to OCR, the image is not upscaled.

5) Click on [Recognise]. The image will now be OCR'd and any
valid textual information is attempted to be extracted. 

You will see that the Recognised text(s) memo shows
BLEV48

The Messages list shows what each subcomponent did

6) You can now click on any of the letter/numbers and see how they
were recognised under "Recognition". This pane also shows alter-
natives
