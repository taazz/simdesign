  Description:

  procedure pgFloodfill will do a floodfill in a pgBitmap. It can
  also be used for magic wand selection.

  Contributors:
  20Jan2004: Chris Riley adapted the floodfill routine to use recursion, much
             faster now.

// Parameters:
// - ABitmap: The bitmap to scan (must be initialized)
// - Sx, Sy: the starting point of the floodfill
// - IncludeFunc: the callback function that will be used. It must return "True" for
//         pixels/colors that should be included. IncludeFunc should also process
//         the bitmap (aka change colors, etc).
// - Info: pointer to information that will be passed to the includefunc, can be nil

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// I have included a directional parameter in the recursive procedure for checking
// pixels.  The purpose for this is to further streamline the process of analyzing
// the pixels for matches.  Since we know that we don't need to check pixels that
// lie BEHIND, it makes sence to use this parameter to determine the direction in
// which the check was issued from.
//
// The resulting process is that each checked pixel spawns up to three new directional
// searches based upon its issued direction.  For example, the CheckUpPixel only
// needs to issue checks for the left and right pixels to it, as well as continuing
// upwards.
