.pas   pascal suourcecode
.dfm   delphi form 
.dpr   delphi project source file

.dof   delphi project config file

.cfg   delphi config file
.dpk   delphi package

When creating a package, source files should *not* be implicitly imported. This way, only the .dpk and .cfg package files need to be stored in SVN.

When creating a few demos, it is easiest to store the .cfg, .dof and .dpr files in SVN so that delphi knows which folders are used in what sequence.
