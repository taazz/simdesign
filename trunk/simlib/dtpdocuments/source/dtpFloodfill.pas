  Unit dtpFloodFill

  procedure Floodfill will do a floodfill in a DIB (TBitmap32). It can
  also be used for magic wand selection.

             faster now.

// Floodfill algorithm that can be used for floodfill, magic wand, etc.
// It will scan ADib starting at X, Y and include all surrounding pixels in the
// bytemap that should be included according to IncludeFunc. All pixels that
// are included will have a value <> 0 in the bytemap.
// Parameters:
// - ADib: The bitmap to scan (must be initialized)
// - AMap: The bytemap that will be filled with the result. Must be initialized,
//         will be set to the same size as ADib. If AMap already contains values,
//         and it is the same size as ADib, they will be preserved.
// - Sx, Sy: the starting point of the floodfill
// - IncludeFunc: the callback function that will be used. It must return "True" for
//         pixels/colors that should be included.
// - SetMapFunc: the callback function used to set a point's byte value in the AMap
//         It can be used to store channel information from a points color
//         or can be used to create a varied mask value (for example, changing
//         value when close to a boundary or creating marching ant outlines)
// - Info: pointer to information that will be passed to the includefunc, can be nil
// - Throttle: integer used to limit the maximum depth of recursive calls before
//         the recursive processing takes a pause and resets

// I have included a directional parameter in the recursive procedure for checking
// pixels.  The purpose for this is to further streamline the process of analyzing
// the pixels for matches.  Since we know that we don't need to check pixels that
// lie BEHIND, it makes since to use this parameter to determine the direction in
// which the check was issued from.
//
// The resulting process is that each checked pixel spawns up to three new directional
// searches based upon its issued direction.  For example, the CheckUpPixel only
// needs to issue checks for the left and right pixels to it, as well as continuing
// upwards.
