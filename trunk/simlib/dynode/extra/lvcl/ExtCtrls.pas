Unit ExtCtrls;

{
   LVCL - Very LIGHT VCL routines
   ------------------------------

   Tiny replacement for the standard VCL ExtCtrls.pas
   Just put the LVCL directory in your Project/Options/Path/SearchPath
   and your .EXE will shrink from 300KB to 30KB

   Notes:
   - implements TImage
   - compatible with the standard .DFM files.
   - only use existing properties in your DFM, otherwize you'll get error on startup
