Unit Dialogs;

{
   LVCL - Very LIGHT VCL routines
   ------------------------------

   Tiny replacement for the standard VCL Dialogs.pas
   Just put the LVCL directory in your Project/Options/Path/SearchPath
   and your .EXE will shrink from 300KB to 30KB

   Notes:
   - dummy unit code to shrink exe size -> use Windows.MessageBox() instead
